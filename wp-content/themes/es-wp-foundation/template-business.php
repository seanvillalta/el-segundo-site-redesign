			<h6>FAQ's</h6>
			<p><strong>Q. How do I get a Library Card?</strong></p>
			<p><i>El Segundo, now home to a population of more than 16,000 people and a number of Fortune 500 Corporate offices, was mostly uninhabited land used for dry farming.</i></p>
			<p><strong>The land was once part of the Sausal Redondo Rancho controlled by Daniel Freeman, the founder of Inglewood. In 1885, most of the rancho was sold in square mile sections to wealthy investors. While the beach areas of the south attracted some residents, the El Segundo and airport land in late 1910 was vacant. Standard Oil Company, recognizing the need for a refinery in Southern California, sent a large party of executives from the East as well as California to scout for a site in November 1910.</strong></p>
			<p><i>In late May 1911, construction had begun on the refinery after a 2-mile long rail spur serving the site was completed. One of the first major tasks was dealing with the sand dunes. About 400 mules, mule-skinners, and Fresno scrapers were brought in to level sites for the refinery structures and storage tanks. In September 1911, Hanna invited Rheem down from San Francisco to "fire" the No. 1 battery of stills starting the production of end products. Raw crude had been accumulating in storage tanks having arrived by pipeline from the Whittier-Fullerton oil fields. By the end of the year, reportedly Standard Oil had spent over $1,000,000 of the $3,000,000 allotted to complete the refinery.</i></p>

			<p>El Segundo may be a small community, but there's no shortage of ways to get here. In fact, few places can offer a location as well suited for the go-anywhere demands of business and industry. In a mere five-square-mile radius, area businesses have access to two major freeways, a light rail station, a bus depot and LAX. We're still working on the shuttle launch pad.</p>
			<p>A hop, skip and a jump from practically everywhere. El Segundo is a backyard community. Of course, that backyard does include LAX. Which means you're never too far away from where you want to be.</p>
